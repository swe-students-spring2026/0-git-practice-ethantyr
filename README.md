## What I found interesing

The post on DEV argues that AI will be the next major abstraction in software development. A key insight is that future developers will likely spend less time manually writing code and more time clarifying problems, reviewing, and editing code while guiding AI tools to help them develop software. That seems like a logical prediction for the progression of software engineering; system design, coordination, and human judgement may matter more than coding ability someday.
